Here we will create a decentralized Mesh network for people in The Netherlands, to use internet-like services, without an ISP.

# Getting started
There are a lot of locations to go for information. Below list should help.

* For any questions, you can ask in the [chat](https://t.me/DeBitcoinMesh), send an email to ![you should see an email address here](https://meshedpotato.network/assets/img/email.png) or [#faq](read the FAQ)
* The main repo is [https://github.com/MeshedPotato/Project-Plans](MeshedPotato/Project-Plans) , please browse through it and add information! Send an email to above address for access if needed, or ask in the chat.
* View [issues](https://github.com/MeshedPotato/Project-Plans/issues) for stuff to help on. We try to tag ["issues" good for beginners](https://github.com/MeshedPotato/Project-Plans/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).
* The website is live at [https://meshedpotato.network/](meshedpotato.network)
* There is a Telegram channel with [github activity](https://t.me/MeshedPotatoGithub) to follow

# FAQ
Frequently asked questions!
## What is the goal?
Start a Mesh Network in The Netherlands. Vision some of us have: it would be cool to be completely independent of the power company and internet service providers, and still be able to send messages! Just put a node and solar panel on your roof and be able to send messages (or Bitcoin transactions!)

## What is a mesh network?
A mesh network is a group of nodes, all connected in some way, just not necessarily all to each other.

```
   A
   |
   B------C----- D
    \   /         \
      E-------------F
```
Above you can see 6 nodes (A,B,C...). A is connected to B only. B is well connected: it can reach A, C and E! A can send a message through A-B-E-F, A-B-D-F or even A-B-C-E-F!

## What is the status of the project?
We are just starting! Join and you will experience the start of something awesome!

## Does it replace the internet?
No, it can live 'next to' the current internet. Maybe some nodes will be connected to the internet?

## Is this for bitcoin only?
It started as a bitcoin idea, but there _must_ be more people interested, so everyone is welcome.

## What will we be able to do with it?
First ideas are: Send messages and send bitcoin transactions. See [https://github.com/MeshedPotato/Project-Plans/tree/master/applications](Applications)

## What does it cost?
As it looks now, we will follow Locha development. Both development kits (lower range) and final units will probably cost around or below 100 EUR.

## Netherlands only?
For now, yes. But join the chat if you think you can help, even if you are outside of NL!

## I did not find my question
Ask in the [chat](https://t.me/DeBitcoinMesh) or [open an issue](https://github.com/MeshedPotato/Project-Plans/issues/new) on this GitHub!


# History
This project grew from the [De Bitcoin Mesh](https://t.me/DeBitcoinMesh) chat.
Most people in this group would like to use the mesh for using Bitcoin, but the plans are broader now.

## Name
The Dutch like [mashed potatos](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aardappelpuree). Take your fork and mash the potatoes on your plate! *Meshed* potato is a play on words. We are people in the Netherlands (around, too?) and we want to build a mesh network!
