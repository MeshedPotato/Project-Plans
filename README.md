Here we will create a decentralized Mesh network for people in The Netherlands, to use internet-like services, without an ISP.

# Getting started

# History
This project grew from the [De Bitcoin Mesh](https://t.me/DeBitcoinMesh) chat. 
Most people in this group would like to use the mesh for using Bitcoin, but the plans are broader now.

## Name
The Dutch like [mashed potatos](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aardappelpuree). Take your fork and mash the potatoes on your plate! *Meshed* potato is a play on words. We are people in the Netherlands (around, too?) and we want to build a mesh network!
