# Locha

LochaMesh is currently building dedicated mesh hardware, utilising 6LoWPAN (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6LoWPAN) tech. These dedicated devices are supposed to have higher range as the develop boards but they are all compatable. For now we want to test/develop on the develop boards. Boards that should be compatable are listed here: https://github.com/btcven/locha/blob/master/documents/turpial-description.md

LochaMesh devs are currently using the following boards, its recommended that you use these:

Radio: LaunchPad CC1312R1 Development Kit
Development board: 356-ESPWROVER-KIT-VB (https://github.com/btcven/locha/blob/master/DS/esp32-wrover_datasheet_en.pdf)

The development board is using a ESP32 chip that can be used to connect to a phone for example. The development board is then connected to the radio board for connecting to the mesh.

If you run into any problems that can't be solved with help from people in our team, the LochaMesh devs are in this telegram channel: https://t.me/Locha_io
